Task 1: Mobile APP sign-up for CodSoft Internship


I recently completed my UI/UX design internship with CodSoft, where I successfully designed a mobile sign-up and login flow as part of my Task. This project involved creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface to ensure a seamless experience for users when registering and logging into the mobile application. I focused on implementing clean, modern design principles and ensuring the process was straightforward and accessible. This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in mobile UI/UX design and provided valuable insights into user-centered design practices.
