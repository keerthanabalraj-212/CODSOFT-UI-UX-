In Task 4 of my CodSoft UI/UX design internship, I created an e-commerce website named "DIVA" for beauty products. The design features a user-friendly header with navigation, search bar, sign-up, cart, and account icons. The hero section includes a promotional banner with a call-to-action for skincare products. Below, the site is organized into categories such as Hair, Skin, Fragrances, Makeup, and Bath & Body. Trending and best-selling products are highlighted to attract users. Promotional banners offer special deals, and the footer provides essential information links, contact details, and service icons for free shipping, authenticity, and easy returns.
